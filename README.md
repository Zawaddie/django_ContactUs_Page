# django_ContactUs_Page

# Build a Contact Us Page

# Objective:
To create a 'Contact Us' page for a website using Django. The page should include a form where users can enter their name, email, and a message. On form submission, the data should be validated and then displayed on a separate page.

# Requirements:
- Use Django to create a new project and a new app.
- Set up the necessary URLs for the ‘Contact Us’ page and the submission results page.
- Create a form using Django's forms module to collect the user’s name, email, and message.
- Implement validation for the form fields:
  - Name: Required, should not contain any numbers or special characters.
  - Email: Required, should be a valid email format.
  - Message: Required, should be at least 10 characters long.
- Upon successful validation, redirect the user to a new page displaying the submitted information.
- If the form data doesn’t validate, display appropriate error messages.
- (optional) create a contact model and save the user data entered


It looks pretty simple but covers areas you have covered so far. This is to be done per group. so every group should come up with their own application
